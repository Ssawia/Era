As the curse progresses, the afflictedâ€™s movements become sluggish as their limbs blacken and crumble, and their resistance to fire-based attacks diminishes. Only through potent cleansing magic or a rare elemental salve can the curse be lifted, though scars remain, serving as a reminder of the fiery torment endured.",
