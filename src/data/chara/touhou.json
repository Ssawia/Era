Like all vampires she is photosensitive and weak when exposed to sunlight, so she typically remains inside her mansion, which has few windows to prevent light getting in, during the day and emerges during the night. While she is naturally known to drink human blood, her light appetite means her victims almost never die from their wounds.",

She has the power to manipulate time, and is known to place knives in midair and resume time to allow these knives to fly towards her targets. Stopping time is also a handy way of doing large amounts of maid work in a short time. Because nearly everyone living and working at the mansion are maids, being the chief of them all means there are almost no people with more authority within the mansion than Sakuya.",
